History of the API

At the start of this project, the desktop client developer requested that I create a versioned API that he could use to communicate with the web app. While this seemed like a good idea at the time, it lead to code duplication and double effort on my part. I asked how to better manage these problems and it was decided that the versioned API was unnecessary for the current state of our app.

For now, new API endpoints will not be versioned.
